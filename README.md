This is a simple todo list web app that I created following the Practical Javascipt
course provided by Gordon Zhu, and his tutorial found @ watchandcode.com

The emphasis of his course was to understand the code and the readability of the code.
I enjoyed his teaching style and emphasis. Instead of focusing on building something from
scratch, I was more focused on learning what the code was doing. Upon completion of his
tutorial, I now have a grasp of some of the fundamentals of JS.



I plan to add my own CSS and update the code in the future to give it my own touch.
